# Camunda Coverage Generation

A Unit testing tool for generating Camunda BPMN Coverage diagrams using BPMN.js

The tool uses Groovy and the Camunda Assertion framework.

# How it works

The coverage generation helpers provide easy to use methods to take
"Coverage Snapshots" at any point during a unit test.

Each snapshot generates "Coverage Data" which is used to generate HTML
files in the build target folder.

The HTML files have all the required data injected into them and are self-contained.
Each .html file uses the bpmnjs renderer loaded through CDN.
